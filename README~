GET MNIST DATASET
@author ICTwangbiao

(1) use MNIST module to import and preprocess MNIST dataset
(2) use getmnist.py to write data into two files(mnistTrain and mnistTest is too big to upload)
(3) the data form just like: feature1 + SPACE + feature2 ... + SPACE + featureN + SPACE + target + '\n'
(4) if you just want to run code file getmnist.py, please goto http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ to download data file and decompress this package into ./data folder, just like ./data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte, and at the same time create two txt files named mnistTest.txt and mnistTrain.txt :)
